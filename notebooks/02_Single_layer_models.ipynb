This makes it easier to reproduce results as the same random draws will produced each time the experiment is run (e.g. the same random initialisations used for parameters). Therefore generally when we need to generate random values during this course, we will create a seeded random number generator object as we do in the cell below."

The aim in a regression problem is given inputs $\\fset{\\vct{x}^{(n)}}_{n=1}^N$ to produce outputs $\\fset{\\vct{y}^{(n)}}_{n=1}^N$ that are as 'close' as possible to a set of target outputs $\\fset{\\vct{t}^{(n)}}_{n=1}^N$. The measure of 'closeness' or distance between target and predicted outputs is a design choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "A very common choice is the squared Euclidean distance between the predicted and target outputs. This can be computed as the sum of the squared differences between each element in the target and predicted outputs. A common convention is to multiply this value by $\\frac{1}{2}$ as this gives a slightly nicer expression for the error gradient. The error for the $n^{\\textrm{th}}$ training example is then\n",

To differentiate between the two we will use $\\bar{E}$ to represent the average error here as opposed to sum of errors $E$ as used in the slides with $\\bar{E} = \\frac{E}{N}$. Normalising by the number of training examples is helpful to do in practice as this means we can more easily compare errors across data sets / batches of different sizes, and more importantly it means the size of our gradient updates will be independent of the number of training examples summed over.*\n",
    "\n",

We will therefore generally use iterative, gradient descent based training methods to find parameters which (locally) minimise the error function. A basic requirement of being able to do gradient-descent based training is (unsuprisingly) the ability to evaluate gradients of the error function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next exercise we will consider how to calculate gradients of the error function with respect to the model parameters $\\mtx{W}$ and $\\vct{b}$, but as a first step here we will consider the gradient of the error function with respect to the model outputs $\\fset{\\vct{y}^{(n)}}_{n=1}^N$.

    "Running the cell below will display an interactive widget which plots the trajectories of gradient-based training of the single-layer affine model on the CCPP dataset in the three dimensional parameter space (two weights plus bias) from random initialisations. Also shown on the right is a plot of the evolution of the error function (evaluated on the current batch) over training. By moving the sliders you can alter the training hyperparameters to investigate the effect they have on how training procedes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Are there multiple local minima in parameter space here? Why?\n",
    "    * In this case there is a single unique global minima, as suggested by the fact random parameter initialisations consistently converge to the same point in parameter space. As mentioned previously there is a closed form solution for the optimal weights and biases for this simple single-layer affine model <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics)'>linear least squares</a>) and the error function is [convex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function).\n",
    "  * What happens to learning for very small learning rates? And very large learning rates?\n",
    "    * For very small learning rates, the training proceeds very slowly and the parameters do not tend to converge to the global optimum unless a lot of training epochs are used. For very large learning rates, the gradient descent dynamic becomes increasingly instable, leading to large oscillations or at extreme values divergence in the parameter space.\n",
    "  * How does the batch size affect learning?\n",
    "    * Smaller batch sizes generally lead to quicker initial learning as the parameters are updated more frequently (more batches in an epoch) however as the batch becomes smaller the error estimate calculated from the batch and its gradients become increasingly noisy estimates for the true error function / gradients. This can be observed by the less smooth trajectories in parameter space for lower batch sizes and greater noise in the batch error curves.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note:** You don't need to understand how the code below works. The idea of this exercise is to help you understand the role of the various hyperparameters involved in gradient-descent based training methods."
